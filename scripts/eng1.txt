THE PORTRAIT  OF A LADY 3

Infer their meaning from the context
MY grandmother like everybodys grandmother  was an old
woman She had been old and wrinkled for the twenty years
that I had known her People said that she had once been
young and pretty and had even had a husband but that was
hard to believe My grandfathers portrait hung above the
mantelpiece in the drawing room He wore a big turban and
loosefitting clothes His long white bear d cover ed the best
part of his chest and he looked at least a hundr ed years old
He did not look the sort of person who would have a wife or
childr en He looked as if he could only have lots and lots of
grandchildr en As for my grandmother being young and pr etty
the thought was almost revolting  She often told us of the
games she used to play as a child That seemed quite absur d
and undignified on her part and we tr eated it like the fables
of the Pr ophets she used to tell us
She had always been short and fat and slightly bent Her
face was a crisscr oss of wrinkles running from everywher e to
everywhere No we wer e certain she had always been as we hadthe thought was almost r evolting
an expanse of pure white serenity

known her Old so terribly old that she could not have grown
older  and had stayed at the same age for twenty years She
could never have been pr etty but she was always beautiful
She hobbled about the house in spotless white with one hand
resting on her waist to balance her stoop and the other telling
the beads of her rosary Her silver locks wer e scatter ed untidily
over her pale puckered face and her lips constantly moved in
inaudible prayer  Yes she was beautiful She was like the winter
landscape in the mountains an expanse of pure white serenity
breathing peace and contentment
My grandmother and I were good friends My parents left me
with her when they went to live in the city and we wer e constantly
together  She used to wake me up in the mor ning and get me
ready for school She said her morning prayer in a monotonous
singsong while she bathed and dressed me in the hope that Iwould listen and get to know it by heart I listened because I
loved her voice but never bother ed to lear n it Then she would
fetch my wooden slate which she had alr eady washed and
plastered with yellow chalk a tiny earthen inkpot and a r ed
pen tie them all in a bundle and hand it to me After a breakfastof a thick stale chapatti with a little butter and sugar spr ead on
it we went to school She carried several stale chapattis with
her for the village dogs
My grandmother always went to school with me because
the school was attached to the temple The priest taught us
the alphabet and the morning prayer While the children sat in
rows on either side of the verandah singing the alphabet or the
prayer in a chorus my grandmother sat inside r eading the
scriptures When we had both finished we would walk back
together  This time the village dogs would meet us at the temple
door They followed us to our home gr owling and fighting with
each other for the chapattis we thr ew to them
When my parents wer e comfortably settled in the city they
sent for us That was  a turningpoint in our friendship Although
we shar ed the same room my grandmother no longer came to
school with me I used to go to an English school in a motor
bus Ther e wer e no dogs in the streets and she took to feeding
sparr ows in the courtyard of our city house
As the years rolled by we saw less of each other For some
time she continued to wake me up and get me ready for schoolWhen I came back she would ask me what the teacher had

THE PORTRAIT  OF A LADY 5
taught me I would tell her English words and little things of
wester n science and learning the law of gravity Ar chimedes
Principle the world being round etc This made her unhappyShe could not help me with my lessons She did not believe in
the things they taught at the English school and was distr essed
that there was no teaching about God and the scriptures One
day I announced that we were being given music lessons She
was very disturbed To her music had lewd associations It was
the monopoly of harlots and beggars and not meant for gentlefolk
She said nothing but her silence meant disapproval She rar ely
talked to me after that
When I went up to University I was given a r oom of my own
The common link of friendship was snapped My grandmotheraccepted her seclusion with resignation  She rarely left her
spinningwheel to talk to anyone From sunrise to sunset shesat by her wheel spinning and reciting prayers Only in the
after noon she r elaxed for a while to feed the sparrows While
she sat in the verandah breaking the bread into little bitshundr eds of little bir ds collected r ound her creating a veritable
bedlam of chirrupings  Some came and perched on her legs
others on her shoulders Some even sat on her head She smiledbut never shooed them away It used to be the happiest half
hour of the day for her 
When I decided to go abroad for further studies I was sur e
my grandmother would be upset I would be away for five years
and at her age one could never tell But my grandmother could
She was not even sentimental She came to leave me at the
railway station but did not talk or show any emotion Her lips
moved in prayer her mind was lost in prayer  Her fingers wer e
busy telling the beads of her rosary Silently she kissed myforehead and when I left I cherished the moist imprint as per haps
the last sign of physical contact between us
But that was not so After five years I came back home and
was met by her at the station She did not look a day older  She
still had no time for words and while she clasped me in her
arms I could hear her r eciting her prayers Even on the first day
of my arrival her happiest moments wer e with her sparr ows
whom she fed longer and with frivolous rebukes 
In the evening a change came over her She did not pray
She collected the women of the neighbourhood got an old drum
and started to sing For several hours she thumped the sagging
Rationalised 202324
6 HORNBILL
skins of the dilapidated drum and sang of the homecoming
of warriors  We had to persuade her to stop to avoid
overstraining  That was the first time since I had known her
that she did not pray
The next morning she was taken ill It was a mild fever and
the doctor told us that it would go But my grandmother thought
differently She told us that her end was near She said that
since only a few hours before the close of the last chapter of herlife she had omitted to pray she was not going to waste any
more time talking to us
We protested But she ignor ed our pr otests She lay peacefully
in bed praying and telling her beads Even before we could
suspect her lips stopped moving and the r osary fell fr om her
lifeless fingers A peaceful pallor spr ead on her face and we knew
that she was dead
We lifted her of f the bed and as is customary laid her on
the gr ound and cover ed her with a red shr oud After a few hours
of mour ning we left her alone to make arrangements for her
funeral In the evening we went to her room with a crude str etcher
to take her to be cremated The sun was setting and had lit herroom and verandah with a blaze of golden light W e stopped
halfway in the courtyard All over the verandah and in her r oom
right up to wher e she lay dead and stif f wrapped in the r ed
shroud thousands of sparrows sat scattered on the floor  Ther e
was no chirruping W e felt sorry for the bir ds and my mother
fetched some bread for them She broke it into little crumbs
the way my grandmother used to and thr ew it to them The
sparr ows took no notice of the bread When we carried my
grandmothers corpse off they flew away quietly Next morning
the sweeper swept the bread crumbs into the dustbin

The car dboard shows me how it was
When the two girl cousins went paddling
Each one holding one of my mothers hands
And she the big girl  some twelve years or so
All three stood still to smile thr ough their hair
At the uncle with the camera A sweet faceMy mothers that was before I was bor n
And the sea which appears to have changed lessWashed their terribly transient feet
Some twenty  thirty  years laterShed laugh at the snapshot See Betty
And Dolly shed say and look how they
Dressed us for the beach The sea holiday
Was her past mine is her laughter Both wry
With the labour ed ease of loss
Now shes been dead nearly as many years
As that girl lived And of this circumstance
