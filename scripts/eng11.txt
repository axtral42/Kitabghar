She was like the winter
landscape in the mountains an expanse of pure white serenity
breathing peace and contentment
My grandmother and I were good friendsMy parents left me
with her when they went to live in the city and we wer e constantly
together  When I went up to University I was given a r oom of my own
The common link of friendship was snapped My grandmotheraccepted her seclusion with resignation  It was a mild fever and
the doctor told us that it would goBut my grandmother thought
differentlyThe car dboard shows me how it was
When the two girl cousins went paddling
Each one holding one of my mothers hands
The sea holiday
Was her past mine is her laughter Both wry
With the labour ed ease of loss
The questions seek to examine factual and infer ential
compr ehension establish empathy and draw attention to the
